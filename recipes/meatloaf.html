        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
            Meatloaf is a dish of a ground meat that has been combined with other ingredients
            and formed into a shape of a loaf, then baked or smoked. The final shape is either
            hand-formed on a baking tray, or pan-formed by cooking it in a loaf pan. It is usually
            made with ground beef, although ground lamb, pork veal, venision, poultry and seafood are
            also used, sometimes in combination. Vegetarian adaptations of meatloaf may use imitation 
            meat or pulses.

        <p>
            The cooked meatloaf can be sliced a loaf of bread to make individual portions. It can easily
            become dry; therefore, various techniques exist to keep the dish moist, like mixing in bread 
            crumbs and egg, covering it with sauce, wrapping it, or using moisture-enhancing ingredients
            in the mixture, such as filling it with fatty meats, rich cheeses, or vegetables.
