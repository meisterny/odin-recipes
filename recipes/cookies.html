    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        MeA chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that features chocolate chips or chocolate morsels as 
        its distinguishing ingredient. Chocolate chip cookies originated in the United States around 1938, 
        when Ruth Graves Wakefield chopped up a Nestlé semi-sweet chocolate bar and added the chopped 
        chocolate to a cookie recipe.

    <p>
        Generally, the recipe starts with a dough composed of flour, butter, both brown and white sugar, 
        semi-sweet chocolate chips, eggs, and vanilla. Variations on the recipe may add other types of 
        chocolate, as well as additional ingredients such as nuts or oatmeal. There are also vegan versions 
        with the necessary ingredient substitutions, such as vegan chocolate chips, vegan margarine, and 
        egg substitutes. A chocolate chocolate chip cookie uses a dough flavored with chocolate or cocoa 
        powder, before chocolate chips are mixed in. These variations of the recipe are also referred to 
        as ‘double’ or ‘triple’ chocolate chip cookies, depending on the combination of dough and chocolate 
        types.
